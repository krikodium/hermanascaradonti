The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and progressed the Hermanas Caradonti Admin Tool project from a bare  to a functional full-stack application. The work was structured into distinct phases, beginning with foundational setup (backend, frontend, auth) and progressively building out complex financial modules with UI and data visualization. Key decisions included using FastAPI with MongoDB, React with Tailwind CSS, JWT for authentication, and Recharts for charting. The engineer demonstrated iterative problem-solving, addressing issues like Pydantic versioning, MongoDB date serialization, and API routing conflicts effectively. The development workflow was systematic, focusing on backend API completeness before frontend UI implementation, and consistently testing work at each stage via API calls and UI screenshots. The project is now in its final phase of module implementation.

<product_requirements>
The Hermanas Caradonti Admin Tool is a web-based administrative dashboard for an events and d√©cor company to replace Excel-based workflows. It requires:
1.  **General Cash Module**: Daily entries (Date, Description, Application, Provider, Income/Expense ARS/USD, Approval Status, Order Link), forms, approval workflows, Twilio/email notifications (user-selectable channels), notification history, inline help.
2.  **Events Cash Module**: Event header (Date, Organizer, Client, Budget), payment status panel (Total Budget, Anticipo, Balance Due), ledger table (Payment Method, Date, Detail, Income/Expense ARS/USD, Running Balance), overdraft validation, large withdrawal approval, scheduled payment notifications.
3.  **Shop Cash Module**: Data table (Date, Provider, Client, Billing Data, Coordinator, Quantity, Item, SKU, Sold Amount ARS/USD, Payment Method, Cost ARS/USD, Net Sale ARS/USD, Profit ARS/USD, Commission, Comments/Status), inventory integration (paginated, search, filter, stock counts, low-stock alerts).
4.  **Deco Movements Module**: Unified ledger (Date, Project Name, Balances ARS/USD), overdue supplier payment alerts, disbursement order requests with approval and notifications.
5.  **Deco Cash-Count (Arqueo) Module**: Reconciliation table (Deco Name, Cash USD/ARS Counted, Profit/Commissions USD/ARS), discrepancy flagging, reconciliation reminders.
The application also needs Dark/Light Mode, a specific minimalist color palette (neutrals, teal accent), JWT-based RBAC (super-admin, area-admin, employee), and a seeded test user (/). The frontend must connect to the backend via  and backend API routes must be prefixed with .

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python web framework), MongoDB (NoSQL database), Pydantic (data validation/serialization), PyJWT (JWT authentication), python-multipart (form data).
-   **Frontend**: React (JavaScript library for UI), Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework), React Router DOM (client-side routing), Recharts (data visualization),  (date utility library).
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack application, RESTful APIs, MVC-like structure.
-   **Security**: JWT-based authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
-   **Infrastructure**: Supervisor (process management), Docker Compose (local development setup).

The project structure is a standard full-stack application setup, divided into  and  directories, with additional top-level files for project management and environment configuration.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : This is the core FastAPI application. It was initially set up with basic health checks and authentication. Major changes involved adding comprehensive API endpoints for all modules (General Cash, Events Cash, Shop Cash, Deco Movements, Deco Cash Count) and implementing JWT authentication. Bug fixes included updating Pydantic  to , handling  serialization issues for MongoDB, and reordering API routes to prevent conflicts (e.g.,  endpoint not being caught by ).
*   : New files were created for each module's data model (e.g., , , ). These define the Pydantic schemas for data validation and MongoDB interaction. The  field consistently uses UUIDs, and date fields were updated to  objects for MongoDB compatibility.
*   : A mock notification service was created here, providing a placeholder for Twilio and email integrations. This allows for future drop-in of real credentials.
*   : This file was rewritten to integrate  for dynamic routing. It now wraps the  component and defines routes for the login page, dashboard, and each specific module (General Cash, Events Cash, Shop Cash, Deco Movements, Cash Count).
*   : This new component provides the overall application layout, including the sidebar navigation, header, and theme toggle. It renders the main content dynamically based on the current route.
*   : Created to handle user authentication, interacting with the backend login API.
*   : This file implements the UI for the General Cash module. It includes a responsive table, a form for new entries, action buttons, and a newly added bar chart for monthly income/expense visualization using Recharts.
*   : This file implements the UI for the Events Cash module, including the static header, payment status panel, detailed ledger table, and a Recharts visualization (e.g., donut chart for payment status).
*   : This file implements the UI for the Shop Cash module, featuring a comprehensive data table, a form/modal for new sale entries with automatic calculations, and Recharts-based data visualizations for monthly profit and profit by coordinator. It also includes an inventory selection modal.
*    and : These are currently placeholder components, ready for their full UI implementation.
*    and : These files were added to resolve previous 404 errors, improving browser tab display and PWA capabilities.
*   : Created to define services for local development, enabling the application to run with Docker.

The codebase now follows a modular structure, separating concerns between backend APIs, data models, frontend components, and routing, facilitating scalable development.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement D) Deco Movements Module**: Develop the complete UI and integrate with backend APIs for project ledger, overdue alerts, and disbursement requests.
-   **Implement E) Deco Cash-Count (Arqueo) Module**: Develop the complete UI and integrate with backend APIs for reconciliation tables, discrepancy flagging, and reminders.
-   **Full Notification System Integration**: While scaffolded, the Twilio (WhatsApp) and email (SendGrid/SMTP) services are currently mocked and need real API key integration to send actual notifications.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was completing **Phase 5: Implementation of the Remaining Modules**. Specifically, the **C) Shop Cash Module** has been fully implemented and tested. This module now features:
-   A comprehensive data table displaying , , , , , , , , , and .
-   A form for creating new sale entries, which correctly handles automatic calculations for  and .
-   Two data visualization charts: a bar chart showing Monthly Profit Trend and a pie chart for Profit by Coordinator (e.g., comparing Ana Rodriguez vs Sofia Martinez performance).
-   An Inventory Modal for product selection, which includes search, filter, pagination, and stock indicators for a smooth user experience.
-   All UI components are fully integrated with the  endpoints.

The  file was the last significant frontend file modified for this module. Backend adjustments were made in  to fix date handling for Shop Cash API endpoints. Test data was created to demonstrate the module's functionality and charts.

Following the completion of the Shop Cash module, the AI engineer proceeded to create placeholder files for the final two modules:
-   
-   

The very last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer stating: Now let me create some test data for both remaining modules and test the complete implementation. This indicates the current work involves populating these new modules with test data and preparing to implement their full UI and logic, starting with Deco Movements.

The next step is to create test data for and then implement the full user interface and integrate APIs for the D) Deco Movements Module.
