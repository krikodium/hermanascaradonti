    message: "Successfully completed comprehensive testing of Deco Movements module backend API endpoints. Fixed critical BSON encoding issue for date objects by adding convert_dates_for_mongo() function calls. All endpoints now working correctly with 100% test success rate (22/22 tests passed). Created realistic test data including 6 movements across 3 projects and 3 disbursement orders with different priorities and statuses. Data validation, authentication, filtering, and pagination all working as expected."
